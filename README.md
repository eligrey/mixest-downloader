Mixest Downloader
=================

The Mixest Downloader Chrome extension adds download functionality to [mixest.com][1].

If you see a box outline, an X, a question mark, or any combination of these instead of a downwards-pointing arrow for the download link, make sure to install a font that supports the U+2B07 "downwards black arrow" character, such as the free [DejaVu fonts][2].
